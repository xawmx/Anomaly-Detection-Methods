# üöÄ**Research on Blockchain Transaction Behavior Regulation Technology**

üéØ **Project Overview**  
This project aims to explore blockchain-based transaction behavior regulation technology by proposing a solution that
combines Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and anomaly detection algorithms. By analyzing and processing Ethereum transaction
data, several deep learning models are constructed to efficiently detect abnormal transaction behaviors, ensuring the
security and stability of blockchain networks.

## üîç **Key Functional Modules**

### üõ† Data Loading and Processing

**`data_load`** function:  
Loads embedding data, train-test edge data, etc., and prints data information.

```python
def data_load(path=data_path, graph_id=3, emb_ratio=0.7):
    pklfile_emb = path + f"LPsubG{graph_id}_df_emb_{emb_ratio}.pickle"
    pklfile_train_test_edges = path + f"LPsubG{graph_id}_train_test_edges_{emb_ratio}.pickle"

    # Load data
    print("Data Loading...")
    df_emb = pd.read_pickle(pklfile_emb)
    if os.path.exists(pklfile_train_test_edges):
        with open(pklfile_train_test_edges, "rb") as f:
            train_test_edges = pickle.load(f)

    print(f"Embedding data shape: {df_emb.shape}")
    return df_emb, train_test_edges
```

### üîó Graph-Related Operations

**`edge_idx_map`** functionÔºö  
edge_idx_map function:
Maps edge indices based on the node dictionary.

```python
def edge_idx_map(self, nodes_dict, edges):
    return list(map(lambda x: (nodes_dict[x[0]], nodes_dict[x[1]]), list(edges)))
```

### ü§ñ Model Construction

TGNN Class:
Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) model for handling time-series graph data.

``` python
class TGNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, temporal_steps, kernel_size):
        super(TGNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = SAGEConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = SAGEConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.temporal_conv = CausalConv1d(
            in_channels, in_channels, kernel_size=kernel_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(hidden_channels, hidden_channels, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, data):
    # Temporal convolution and node feature learning
        temporal_features = torch.stack([data.x[t] for t in range(self.temporal_steps)], dim=2)
        enhanced_features = self.temporal_conv(temporal_features)
        node_features = []
        for t in range(self.temporal_steps):
            x = enhanced_features[:, :, t]
            x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x, data.edge_indexs[t]))
            x = self.conv2(x, data.edge_indexs[t])
            node_features.append(x)
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(torch.stack(node_features, dim=1))
        return lstm_out[:, -1, :]
```
